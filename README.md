### 🍋 Arithmetics ✖️➖➗

Given the variable:

```dart
double tempInFahrenheit = 86;
```

Using dart arithmetics, convert the temperature to `Celsius`, using this formula:

```
Fahrenheit to Celsius:   (°F − 32) / 1.8 = °C
```

Print the result like the following:

```
86F = 30C
```

### 🤼‍♂️ Floats Methods

Read these [docs](https://api.dart.dev/stable/2.16.1/dart-core/num/toStringAsFixed.html).

In your output, show at most 1 fractional digit.

### 🌶 Vice Versa

Do it the other way around, convert `Celsius` to `Fahrenheit`.

```
Celsius to Fahrenheit: °C * 1.8000 + 32.00 = °F
```

### 🍋 Conditionals❓

Define an integer variable called `mark`.

Then, print different results depending on the following conditions:

```
if `mark` is more than or equal to 80
    print A
if `mark` is more than or equal to 70 and less than 80
    print B
if `mark` is more than or equal to 60 and less than 70
    print C
if `mark` is more than or equal to 50 but less than 60
    print D
otherwise
    print F
```

Finally, verify that the code works correctly for different values of the `mark` variable.

### 🤼‍♂️ More Practice: FizzBuzz

Define an integer variable called `i`.

```
if i is divisible by 3 and 5
    print "fizz buzz"
if i is divisible by 3
    print "fizz"
if i is divisible by 5
    print "buzz"
otherwise
    print i
```
💡Hint: you'll need to use the integer modulo operator `%`.


### 🌶 Switch Case
Using `switch` statements, create a calculator with the following operations: ("+","-","/","*") and the following variables (x,y,operation). Print the result of each operation that was applied on y and x.
